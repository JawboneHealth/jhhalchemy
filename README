 Jawbone Health SQLAlchemy base model and CRUD methods
====================

This is the base model that all Jawbone Health MySQL models inherit from.

JHHAlchemy defines a declarative base model for JHH database tables.

To use the model:

1. Once you've established the db object in your app, intialize jhhalchemy.

import jhhalchemy
jhhalchemy.init_db(<flask_sqlalchemy object>)

2. Now you can import the base model and inherit from it.

import jhhalchemy.models
class MyModel(jhhalchemy.models.Base):
    ...
